I am not sure what happened, but it seemed like they might have decided to include an original composition very last minute because when I received the final guidelines a few days after making first contact, I was only given one night to deliver. It was a pretty long night, but I quite enjoy the final outcome. Sometimes projects turn out to be best when you don’t overthink them.</p>\n<p>You can watch the film online.
