I am passionate about working on **human-centred projects** that involve novel technology, data-driven research and multi-disciplinary collaboration. My main occupation is a UKRI funded **PhD** at
the Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) that focuses on Music Technology
and Human Computer Interaction; but I am frequently involved in
organising and managing additional projects, events and exhibitions,
working with a variety of people across disciplines.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my
work, want to collaborate or just want to exchange ideas.
