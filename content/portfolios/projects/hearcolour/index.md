This project is part of my ongoing collaboration with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/saitischaralampos.html">Charalampos Saitis</a> at the Centre for Digital Music. I developed this webapp to collect data about colour associations of the audience during a music performance by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://xeniapestovabennett.com/">Xenia Pestova Bennett</a> on the Magnetic Resonator Piano by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://andrewmcpherson.org/">Andrew McPherson</a> at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://iklectikartlab.com/hearing-colour-sonic-worlds-and-other-senses/">Iklectik</a> venue in London. The audience could use their phones to pick a colour that then appeared as a moving blob on a large screen behind the performer.

I set myself the challenge to complete the project within a week organised as a design sprint that followed these steps:

- define the performance setup and **explore different approaches**
- create paper prototypes, discuss with collaborators and **decide on approach** (I ended up using a similar design to "press and hold button to confirm" that is used in some PlayStation games)
- **build prototype** in React.js, p5.js and WebGL
- **test prototype** on different devices and conduct **quick & dirty** evaluation with friends and colleagues
- organise mock performance with **focus group** of ~10 participants to evaluate improved prototype in action 
- implement feedback and code **simulation of 100 users** to test finished webapp
- write documentation and upload to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SFRL/hearing-colour-app">GitHub</a>

The event was a full success with close to 100 visitors. I managed to complete all planned steps in time, reassuring myself that I can quickly deliver a project if needed.
