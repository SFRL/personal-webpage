description: This project extends the online Seeing Music project to the "real world".  It allows people to draw on a digital interface with their fingers. We presented the work at the Festival of Communities 2022 where visitors drew their associations with music. Not only was it an engaging way to present our work, but also a handy way to collect data for further research.

I built a touchscreen from a computer screen, a transparent touchpad and plywood using a laser cutter. The digital drawing interface was created with the JavaScript library p5.js to run completely in a web browser.
