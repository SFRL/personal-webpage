figcaption: The audio-visual essay in action.
description: This is an audio-visual essay that I created during my Masters. It's an experimental setup that uses signal processing techniques to generate weird sounds and visuals.

 This project combines digital signal processing, generative music and music visualisation with interactive story telling and contemporary art theory. I developed it at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths University of London</a> together with my partner who studied **Contemporary Art Theory**. We developed a narrative of a lab computer that contains a number of log files including conversations and experiments based on one of her essays. On this basis, I developed a game like environment that can be explored through text commands.
