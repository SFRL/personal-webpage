I really got into coding during my Masters at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/">Goldsmiths University of London</a>, but since Goldsmiths is a notorious art university, artistic concepts, ideas and expression were at least as important as being a good programmer and technologist. For this project, I teamed up with my wife who studied **Contemporary Art Theory** and wanted to "spice up" one of her essays. We developed a narrative of a lab computer that contains a number of log files including conversations and experiments based on her essay. On this basis, I developed computer programme that can be explored through simple typed commands to produce audio-visual content.

Taking the scientific background story of the project, I based the creation of the audio-visual content on concepts from signal processing like the **Fast-Fourier Transformation**, **Sonogramms** or **Oscilloscopes**. The whole programme was realised in <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cycling74.com/">Max/MSP and Jitter</a> and compiled as a standalone app to accompany the essay.

This project really shows how technical concepts can be used to create experimental art. Personally, I found it to be a quite motivating way to learn about some concepts that I would otherwise find quite dry.
