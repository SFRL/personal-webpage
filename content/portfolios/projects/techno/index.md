description: This is a project that I developed during the last year of my undergraduate. It's a programme that can generate an infinite number songs in an EDM style from a set of rules.

While researching topics for my final undergraduate project, I came across the programming language  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cycling74.com/">Max/MSP</a> which made me realise that I could use my technical skills in a creative, musical context. 

I started this project by thinking about how generative algorithm could impact the way that artists produce music. Imagine that rather than listening to a fixed number of songs of an artist you could listen to an **infinitely generated stream of music** following a style that the artist defined. For the *Technosong Generator*, I attempted to achieve exactly that. I create a large map of possible states for harmony, melody, rhythm and instruments and probabilities for transitions between them (basically a large Markov Chain) to generate electronic dance music with a dark techno vibe. Have a listen at the result:
