If you participated in academic studies before, you might agree that they are often quite bland. Gamifying a study by incorporating game elements like a point system, an intriguing aesthetic or interaction with other participants can improve user experience and potentially lead to more and higher quality submissions.

In *Seeing Sounds, Hearing Shapes*, sketches and sounds have to be matched. For each correct match a player receives a point and after submission they can compare their score with other players. The sketches were created in a different study where people had to sketch their associations with the sounds. **Check out the research section of my website to learn more** and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phd-studies-eddd5.web.app/">click here to try it yourself!</a>. I managed to get over 80 participants through this concept without much recruitment effort which is amazing and participants gave overwhelmingly positive feedback about the design.   

The project was part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/">Ars Electronica Festival 2020</a> exhibition *The Garden of Forking Paths* that I organised together with other members of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mat.qmul.ac.uk/">Media & Technology CDT</a>. The festival was largely held online and you can still access our contribution <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forkingpaths.intersections.io/">online</a>.
