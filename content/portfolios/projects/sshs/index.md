description: This is a gamified academic survey that I developed to verify findings from a previous study where I asked people to draw their associations with different sounds. In this project, a visitor will hear the same sounds and see 4 possible drawings and has to find the "right" match. It was first presented at Ars Electronica 2020.

Everyone who has ever participated in a few academic studies probably knows that they are not the most exciting thing in the world. Consequently, as a researcher it can be quite difficult to convince people to participate in your experiments, especially if you don't have the funds to reimburse them. To make the participant recruitment process a bit more pleasant, I started to **gamify my studies** whenever possible. Basically, this means to somewhat disguise their academic nature and **introduce elements from games** like a score system, a visual intriguing environment, a compelling narrative or a controllable avatar to name a few.

In *Seeing Sounds, Hearing Shapes*, you have to find the right match between a drawing and a sound. The drawings have been produced by different people in another study. **Check out the research section of my webpage** to learn more. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://phd-studies-eddd5.web.app/">You can try it yourself!</a>

The project was part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/">Ars Electronica Festival 2020</a> exhibition *The Garden of Forking Paths* that I organised together with other members of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://mat.qmul.ac.uk/">Media & Technology CDT</a>. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fesitval was held almost entirely online that year which means that you still access our contribution <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forkingpaths.intersections.io/">online</a>.

I managed to get over 80 participants through this concept without much recruitment effort which is amazing. In addition, I was **shortlisted for an award** by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/publicengagement/reward-and-recognition/e-and-i-awards/public-engagement-awards/">Centre for Public Engagement</a> at Queen Mary university of London for leading the organisation of our festival contribution!
