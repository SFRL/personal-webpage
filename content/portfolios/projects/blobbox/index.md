description: This project combines motion capture and physical modelling to create a digital environment that a user can interact with in an intuitive way through simple hand movements. Originally developed for a university assignment it was later presented at Ars Electronica 2019.

I developed this project during the first year of my PhD when I was leaning more in the direction of motion capture. It first started when I got my hands on a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion Sensor</a> that can capture your hand movements and communicate them to your computer. I wanted to explore modes of interactions that can be achieved with the sensor that wouldn't be possible with a mouse and/or keyboard. This inspired creating a digital 3-dimensional environnement that contains a *liquid blob*. A user can interact with this blob in various ways by simple hand gestures. Have a look at the video below to get an idea:

While this is mainly a quirky, fun project without a real-life application in mind, I find it interesting to see that we could interact with our computers in very different ways. My setup definitely makes it much easier to transform a digital 3D object and arguably more fun. What kind of other applications could be developed with this concept?

This was a great project to explore different topics like **motion capture, interaction design and physical modelling** and delve deeper into <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>.
