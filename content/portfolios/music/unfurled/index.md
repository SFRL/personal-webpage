Together with *It just sort of happened one day* and *Half Sewn*, *Unfurled* forms a triple bill of dance performances that was first presented at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://richmix.org.uk/events/thrive-dance-triple-bill/">Rich Mix</a> in London in 2022. I composed the music, arranged the electronic bits and hired a session musician to play the cello.
