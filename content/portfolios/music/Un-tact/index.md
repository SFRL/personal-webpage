description:  I composed this piece for a screendance research project by contemporary dancer and coreographer Yerin Lee. The idea was to mix traditional Korean rhythms with contemporary electronic dance music.

For me the biggest challenge was to avoid making a pastiche that just has tradiational music playing over a dance beat, but rather really merge the two components into a coherent composition. The Corona pandemic made the collbaroation a little bit more difficult, but I am very pleased with the final outcome!

Screendance is a really interesting concept where film is cut to music as a form of coregraphy. You should check out  <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://yenndance3639.wixsite.com/yenndance/research">Yerin's work </a> if you want to learn more.
