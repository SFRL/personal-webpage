description: This is short music piece that I composed as the "theme song" for the short film You Should Know Better. The guidelines for this composition were to produce something sounding like hipster electropop.

I found this opportunity through a mailing list and never actually met the people who produced the short film until way after it was finished. I am not sure what happened, but it seemed like they might have decided to include an original composition very last minute because when I received the final guidelines a few days after making first contact, I was only given one night to deliver. It was a pretty long night, but I quite enjoy the final outcome. Sometimes projects turn out to be best when you don't overthink them.

You can watch the film online. It was first aired at the Curzon Cinema in New Cross, London. Pretty cool to hear you own music play in a cinema I must say!
