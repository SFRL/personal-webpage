During my Masters I was quite keen on getting composing opportunities and I heard about this project through an internal mailing list. Sarah is quite an established choreographer with her own <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.thrivedance.co.uk/it-just-sort-of-happens-one-day">dance company</a> and it was a joy working with her. We managed to establish a lasting artistic collaboration and are still working on new projects. It was a good idea to reply to that e-mail some years ago.
