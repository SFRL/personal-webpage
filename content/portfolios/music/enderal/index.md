description: This is a piano composition for the video game Enderal by Sure Ai. I received a short theme from their main composer and developed an eerie piano piece from it that can be heard in a certain part of the game world.

I received this opportunity through a friend who worked on the game and at the time, I had know idea how big this project would turn out to be. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://sureai.net/games/enderal/"> Enderal </a> is a full game conversion mod based on the popular game Skyrim. Since its release in 2016 it won a number od prizes and has a large fan following. Here is some in-game footage that features the piece:

I had a number of people contact me for sheet music. Unfortunately, I never wrote anything down, but rather devised the general structure of the piece and improvised the rest.
