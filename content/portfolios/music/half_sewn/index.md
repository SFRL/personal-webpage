description: The composition for this choreography takes the listener on a journey from warm, domestic sounds with female singing voices to a harsh, mechanical soundscape and back.

This is the second composition in my on-going collaboration with <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.thrivedance.co.uk/it-just-sort-of-happens-one-day">Sarah Poekert</a>. The piece is somewhat of a coming-of-age story mixed with Greek mythology, at least that's my interpretation. It premiered at the Victoria & Albert museum in April 2022 and more performances are scheduled for the future. Stay tuned!
